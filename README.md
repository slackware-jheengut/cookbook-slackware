Slackware Cookbook
=================
**Alpha release, do not expect this to work.**

This cookbook adds basic support for the Slackware platform.
Native resources 'package' and 'service' are expanded, you wont need to use specific resources.
Also exports a 'slackware_package' resource, just in case.

Please report issues.
